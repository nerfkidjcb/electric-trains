tech-electric-trains=Specially designed trains that use Electric Powerpacks instead of fuel.
tech-alkaline-battery-pack=An inexpensive alternative to rechargable Powerpacks that have a high fuel value at the cost of acceleration and top speed. Alkaline Powerpacks are not rechargable.
tech-electric-trains-braking-force=From the continued testing and research of Electric Trains, the braking force of the Electric and Non-Electric Trains can be increased by 5%.
tech-electric-trains-experimental-charging=From the continued testing and research of Electric Trains, a new experimental charging station has been developed that can charge Electric Train Powerpacks at 300% speed. There is, however, a much higher chance that the Powerpack will be destroyed during the charging process.
tech-electric-locomotive-wagon=Unlocks Electric Wagon Locomotive that is functionally identical to the Electric Locomotive but resembles an electric cargo wagon. Useful for longer train configuration aesthetics.
tech-electric-artillery-wagon=Unlocks Electric Artillery Wagon that runs on maglev technology and has a higher shell capacity and top speed than the standard artillery wagon.
tech-acceleration-battery-pack=An experimental Electric Train Powerpack that has a higher acceleration (+50%) than the standard Electric Train Powerpack. This comes at the cost of a lower top speed (-20%) and fuel value (-20%).
tech-speed-battery-pack=An experimental Electric Train Powerpack that has a higher top speed (+50%) than the standard Electric Train Powerpack. This comes at the cost of a slightly lower acceleration (-20%) and fuel value (-20%).
tech-efficiency-battery-pack=An experimental Electric Train Powerpack that has a higher fuel value (+200%) than the standard Electric Train Powerpack. No other trade offs to this one!
