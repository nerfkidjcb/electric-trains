Version: 0.3.2
Date: 31. 10. 2024
  Info:
    - Updated for factoripedia simulations
    - Added zh-CN localisation (Thanks to Houraiji_Kyuusyou for the PR)
    - Formatted the codebase properly (finally)
  Features:
    - (Space Age) Added a startup setting (default true) to lock electric train tech behind electromagnetism. This also update recipes to utiluse electromagnetic facilities and newer materials
    - (Space Age) You can only stack one electric Locomotive/Wagon in a rocket at a time. (I would encourage crafting on site)
    - Added electrical pickup/placement inventory sounds
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed scaling issue where charged and destroyed powerpacks were very small when placed on ground or belts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.1
Date: 29. 10. 2024
  Features:
    - Officially supported for elevated rails. Added sounds and graphics. Thanks to FragJacker for updating the sprites in se-space-trains.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.3.0
Date: 27. 10. 2024
  Features:
    - Both charging stations can connect to the circuit network and support 2.0 assembling machine logic. (Set recipe, read ingredients, working + completed status)
    - Charging stations have been given module slots (2 for standard and 4 for experimental) (efficiency or speed modules)
    - Charging stations can now be affected by beacons (efficiency or speed effects)
    - Support for quality and recyling! Powerpacks have acceleration and speed modifiers. (Top tip - put quality modules in your charging stations and make sure to adjust charging and refurb recipes as well as logistic filters for higher tier packs. Also, don't put charged packs in a recycler, that can only go badly...)
    - Included "Extended" (3x Vanilla) start up settings for fluid wagon capacity, and max speeds. Thanks to H4ckerxx44 for the PR
  Bugfixes:
    - Reimplemented lighting/reflection graphics that were no longer accessible from update 2.0.
    - As a result of the work on modules/effects, the issue where the experiemental charging station appears to not have full power has been fixed.
  Balancing:
    - Efficiency powerpacks have significantly increased fuel value (120MJ -> 240MJ)
    - Standard powerpack refurbishment requires less (200 -> 20) sulfuric acid and less (120 -> 60 seconds) time.
    - Experiemental (Speed, Acceleration, Efficiency) powerpack refurbishment requires more (5 -> 10) battieres. 
    - Adjusted minimum energy consumption for both charging stations. (Standard 500W -> 56.67kW, Experiemental 500W -> 333kW)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 29. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - New item and technology
  Features:
    - Alkaline PowerPacks are here! These can be researched immediately after electric trains and are an inexpensive way to run your electric train network. They have a high fuel value but cannot be recharged or refurbished. Trains run with decreased top speed and acceleration when using them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Made some migrations in mod files to be more compatible with other mods. (You will be hit with a migrated content pop up when loading into an older versioned save, but don't worry! Nothing will be affected.)
  Quality of Life:
    - Electric fluid wagon now appears before the artillery wagon (next to vanilla fluid wagon) in the crafting menu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.3
Date: 26. 01. 2024

    - Fixed bug where increased powerpack fuel value was not being applied to higher tier powerpacks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 25. 01. 2024

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 24. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Added compatibility for the Space Exploration mod. All researches and most recipes will be updated if you have the mod active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 13. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - This is a bigger update, with new features, balancing and quality of life changes from hours of play testing.
    - Added three new researches: Acceleration Train Powerpack, Speed Train Powerpack and Efficiency Train Powerpack.
    - Each research unlocks a new experimental powerpack that has its own unique properties. They can be charged at the experimental charging station and refurbished at a chemical plant.
    - As a result of this, you can now select the recipes in Experimental Train Powerpack Charging Stations. (Your old stations will still work, and you won't need to select the recipe again)
  Features:
    - Speed Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher top speed than the regular powerpack, but has a lower acceleration and fuel efficiency.
    - Acceleration Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher acceleration than the regular powerpack, but has a lower top speed and fuel efficiency.
    - Efficiency Train Powerpack: This powerpack has a higher fuel efficiency than the regular powerpack, and no other downsides.
    - New icons for the experimental powerpacks, you can differentiate them by their a subtle colour change in the icon respective to the module they take. Yep, that's right. Each powerpack takes a tier 3 module to craft, making them quite expensive. This is to balance the huge benefits they can present.
  Quality of Life:
    - Electric Locomotives now have three output slots, to avoid "No burnt result space" messages stopping your trains during a phased powerpack changeover, or running your network on a mix of powerpacks.
    - You can now manually select the recipes to be completed by charging stations. (Please submit a FAQ if you want the icon to display over the building in alt mode, I am still undecided on this)
    - Better ordering of menu items.
  Balancing:
    - Increased crafting time of all Powerpack charging stations.
    - Increased destroyed powerpack refurbishment time.
    - Decreased the default powerpack fuel value.
    - All spent fuel items have a max stack of 20, due to the QOL change above.
    - You no longer need to research space science to unlock experimental charging stations, but you do have to research Electric Wagon Locomotive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 09. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Updated changelog to work with Factorio's parser.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 09. 01. 2024
  Info:
    - Added the Electric Wagon Locomotive.
  Features:
    - Introduces the Electric Wagon Locomotive. This is the same as the Electric Locomotive, but with the visual properties of a wagon. This helps the aesthetics of longer train configurations such as 2-8. This can be unlocked after researching the Electric Wagon Locomotive research.
  Balancing:
    - Battery refurbishment is now a little more expensive, although no ingredients have changed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Experimental charging stations use a lot more power than regular charging stations.
    - Longer powerpack charge times.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Initial release
    - Forked from se-space-trains
  Features:
    - Rebranded research and added new infinite research.
    - Renamed all new entities and items.
